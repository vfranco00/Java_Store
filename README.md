<h1>College Project - POO II 🚀</h1>

<h3>🏗🚧👷 Still under construction 🏗🚧👷</h3>

<main>
At this moment, the system will only have CLASSES and METHODS, without DB

The goal is to implement, using the 5 GRASP patterns seen in the last class.

The system should include the following features:

- Supplier supplies products
- Products, when purchased from the supplier, go into stock
- A customer can buy products from stock
- A purchase will generate a coupon, with the total value of the purchase and a list of products
- The customer can make payment for the purchase
