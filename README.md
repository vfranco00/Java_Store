<h1>College Project - POO II 🚀</h1>

<h3>🏗🚧👷 Still under construction 🏗🚧👷</h3>

<main>
<p>At this moment, the system will only have CLASSES and METHODS, without DB</p>

<p>The goal is to implement, using the 5 GRASP patterns seen in the last class.</p>

<ul>The system should include the following features:
  <li> Supplier supplies products</li>
  <li> Products, when purchased from the supplier, go into stock</li>
  <li> A customer can buy products from stock</li>
  <li> A purchase will generate a coupon, with the total value of the purchase and a list of products</li>
  <li> The customer can make payment for the purchase</li>
</ul>
</main>
